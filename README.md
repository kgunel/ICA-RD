# ICA-RD
This repository includes the implementation of Imperialist Competitive Algorithm with Regional Domination Policy. The implementation are coded via Matlab by modifying the Yarpiz code for basic ICA. Special thanks goes to S. Mostapha Kalami Heris as developer (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52903-imperialist-competitive-algorithm-ica).
